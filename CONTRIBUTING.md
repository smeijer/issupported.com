# Contributing

Thanks for being willing to contribute!

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this _free_
series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][egghead]

## Project setup

1.  Fork and clone the repo
2.  Run `npm ci` to install dependencies
3.  Create a branch for your PR with `git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name`

> Tip: Keep your `develop` branch pointing at the original repository and make
> pull requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>
> ```
> git remote add upstream git@github.com:testing-library/testing-playground.git
> git fetch upstream
> git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/develop develop
> ```
>
> This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream," Then
> fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local `develop`
> branch to use the upstream develop branch whenever you run `git pull`. Then you
> can make all of your pull request branches based on this `develop` branch.
> Whenever you want to update your version of `develop`, do a regular `git pull`.

## Committing and Pushing changes

Please make sure to run the tests before you commit your changes. You can run
`npm run test` to do so.

### Linting with git hooks

There are git hooks set up with this project that are automatically installed
when you install dependencies. They're really handy, and will take care of linting
and formatting for you.
